  "name": "Smart Text Assistant",
  "description": "Explain, summarize, or perform custom actions on selected text",
  "icon": "üß†",
  "enabled": true,
  "actions": [
    {
      "id": "explain",
      "name": "Explain",
      "description": "Understand difficult words, jargon, or sentences",

  ]
}
```

## Error Handling

The API includes comprehensive error handling:
- **400**: Empty text, invalid action, missing custom_prompt for custom actions
- **500**: AI model errors or internal server errors

## Next Steps for Frontend Integration

1. **Text Selection**: Implement text selection detection on web pages
2. **Context Menu**: Show Smart Text Assistant options when text is selected
3. **Popup Interface**: Create UI for the three actions with input field for custom prompts
4. **Results Display**: Show the AI's response in a clean, readable format
5. **Loading States**: Handle async API calls with proper loading indicators
